## Conclusion

Achieving high performance on million-node graphs requires a multi-faceted approach combining algorithmic improvements, data structure optimizations, and hardware-aware implementations. The highest impact comes from foundational optimizations like direction-optimized BFS and efficient graph representations, followed by algorithm-specific techniques like bidirectional search and delta-based iterations.

For the Graphty library, focusing on Priority 1 and 2 optimizations will provide the best return on investment, potentially achieving 10-100x speedups over naive implementations while maintaining code clarity and portability.
