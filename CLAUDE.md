## DevOps
- Use "lts/*" as our node version for GitHub Actions
- NEVER commit code or stage changes for me
- our server only allows incoming connections on ports 9000 through 9099
- keep the number of npm commands to a minimum
- never add files to git for me

## Testing
- don't increase testing or test coverage of the floyd-warshall module or it will cause vitest to hang
